        <h1>Heritage Site - Temple</h1>
        <img src="ratneshwari.jpeg" alt="Heritage Site " class="heritage-img">
        <p>It was built by Aman Dev The temple is elegantly constructed in the classical style with a Nagara Shikhara and Samvarna mandapa. The site of the temple is very unusual. Unlike all other temples in Varanasi on the banks of Ganga, the temple is built at a very low level. In fact, the water level can reach the shikhara part of the temple.</p>
        <p>It is constructed at a very low spot; the builder must have known that its garbhagriha would be underwater for much of the year. In spite of much of the temple being underwater during most of the year, it is well preserved, except for the lean that can be noted in 20th century photos.

            A number of online posts have falsely stated that the temple is 74 m high, however the actual height is estimated to be somewhere around 13 m.</p>

        <h2>History of Ratneshwari Temple</h2>
        <br>    
        <p>The Temple is also known as Kashi Karvat (Kashi is the ancient name for Varanasi and karvat means leaning in Hindi). The actual time of construction is unknown. However, the priests claim it was built by an unnamed servant of Raja Man Singh for his mother Ratna Bai about 500 years ago. According to the revenue records, it was constructed from 1825 to 1830. However, according to Dr. Ratnesh Varma of District Cultural Committee, it was constructed by the Amethi royal family. James Prinsep, who was an assay master at the Banaras Mint from 1820 to 1830, created a series of drawings, one of which includes the Ratneshwar Mahadev temple. He commented that when the temple entrance was underwater, the priest used to dive in the water to conduct worship.</p>
