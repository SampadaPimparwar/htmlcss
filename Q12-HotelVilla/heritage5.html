        <p>The most important festival at Shree Kaleshwara Mandira is the five-day Mahashivaratri Utsava, in which the idol of Kaleshwara is drawn out of the temple in its chariot. The festival is accompanied by a fair and attracts visitors from great distances. Other festivals include Maghi Ganesha Utsava, celebrated in the month of Maagha, and Navratri Utsava.</p>
        <h2>History of Kaleshwar</h2>
        <p>
            It is dedicated to the village deity, Shree Kaleshwara, who is also called Kaloba. The temple dates back 700 to 800 years, when, according to legend, a brahmin dug into the ground and discovered a natural lingam, an emblem of Shiva. The temple was founded on that spot, and the lingam is now enshrined in the temple's sanctum sanctorum.        </p>
