        <p>Takhat Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib is the main Gurudwara of Nanded and is one of the five High seats of Authority of the sikhs. This is the place where Shri GuruGobind Singhji breathed his last.The Gurudwara is situated in Nanded Town. The Gurudwara was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singhji, The great Ruler of Punjab between 1830 to 1839 A.D. Inside the Gurudwara, which contains the mortal remains of the 10th Guru, there are exhibited a number of weapons of various kinds.</p>
        <h2>History of GuruDwara</h2>
        <p>The Eternal Father willed and I raised the Panth. All my Sikhs are hereby ordered to accept the Granth as their Preceptor. Have faith in the holy Granth, as your master and consider it the visible manifestation of the Gurus. He who hath a pure heart will seek guidance from its holy words."
            ........These are the words uttered by Guru Sri Gobind Singh ji, before he left for his heavenly abode (Parlok Gaman) along with his horse Dilbag on October 7, 1708 at Nanded in Maharashtra.
        <p>A few days before Parlok Gaman, Guru Gobind Singh ji ended the line of personal Guruship by appointing the "Granth Sahib" (Gur-Ta-Gaddi) as his official successor with the status of ‘Eternal Guru’. His objective was great and laudable. He fully realized that human beings are perishable, but noble ideas live forever – they are eternal. </p>
